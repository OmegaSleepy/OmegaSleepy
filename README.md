### 🐧 Fun Fact
I have two systems, one on win10. I have begun to dislike it as of late and planning to switch to Linux.
My school daily driver is **Linux Mint Cinnamon** personal laptop. I value the speed and simplicity it gives plus, it saved my laptop from the trash and now it runs IntelliJ Idea like a charm! And PyCharm too 😂!
