# Zdraveite! I'm Martin! 🇧🇬 

I am a programming hobbyist from **Stara Zagora, Bulgaria**, I focus on building architecturally sound, scalable backend systems. I enjoy designing complex systems that are easy to maintain and perform well.

### Currently Working On...
- **[Умения+]:** A Java Spark project focusing on a fun way to learn and teach [very early in development].  
- **A fabric minecraft mod:** Learning how to effectively use APIs that I am not familiar with and writing util to simplify implementation.   
- Check my pins for more of my work!

### OS
I have two systems, one on **win10** and another one on **Linux Mint Cinnamon**. I have begun to dislike win10 as of late and plan on switching to Linux exclusively.   
My school daily driver is the linux system - personal laptop. I enjoy the speed and simplicity it gives plus, it saved my laptop from the trash and now it runs IntelliJ Idea like a charm! And PyCharm too 😂

### My Favorite Repos
- Mindustry [link](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) - A really cool Tower Defence game, with amazing UI and sophisticated architecture.
- I don't get a single line of [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg), but I just love the tool.
